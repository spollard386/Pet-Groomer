[Software Design & Engineering](https://github.com/spollard386/Spollard.github.io/tree/main/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering)

This is Texturing a Pyramid module it was created for class CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. the premise of this project was to create a 3D pyramid with added Texture. My enhancement changed the tradional texture and also added a rotating light source circles the 3D pyramid showing the light hitting 3 faces of the pyramid with an amber lighting.

[Algorithm and Data Structure](https://github.com/spollard386/Spollard.github.io/tree/main/Algorithm%20and%20Data%20Structure)

C++ Program developed and written in Visual Studio
Where a 1D object was enhanced create a 3D Cube 
including adding a rotational aspect  to the cube as well as full
mouse control so that the view is able to pull the cube closer
and futher should the user choose to. I also added a personal touch just to remind myself why I create this.

### Databases

[Databases](https://github.com/spollard386/Spollard.github.io/tree/main/Database)

Created using Visual Studio and enhanced with Pycharm 
and SQlite3. a databese was created with specific tables 
and imported information though sqlite3. this project was to show the creation
of a Student Registration database in SQL while learning PyCharm and well as SQlite3 both whom I've never worked with before, and it turned out better than I had imagined
