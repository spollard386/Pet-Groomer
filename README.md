 ## Self Assesment
 
 My name is Samantha Pollard, and I am currently a student enthusiastically working toward achieving a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University
My academic career path weaves through the dynamic domain of computer science, developing from comprehensive studies in software design, engineering principles, data structures, and databases to the unraveling of the algorithms' complexities
This carefully developed ePortfolio serves multifunctional purposes, all consolidated into one place: acting as a digital canvas where I can artfully display the mosaic of abilities and talents, I've been able to develop during my dedicated tenure at SNHU.
More than a simple compilation of my accomplishments, this digital portfolio is a visual creation that I have designed with care to extend past the barriers of academia, demonstrating my competence and worth to any prospective employer in the professional world.
When one looks deep into the core of this portfolio, every piece of content inside becomes a point of origination in itself, being able to represent not only what I can do but also the journey of my skill to date. 
As I walk through essential aspects such as software design, engineering methodologies, data structures, databases, and algorithms, this portfolio serves as a testimony to my journey of growth in these areas and the level of competency I have so far managed to achieve.
Some of the diverse artifacts, as chosen for this ePortfolio, manifest my improved ability in their domain, while others provide a nuanced discussion of the competency
They all play a part as illustrative examples of my flexibility, showing I am good in most of the critical expert domains
Every single artifact, handpicked as it were, had to be polished up and presented in a way that would easily pass the requirements of the course, as outlined by SNHU
not just to pass academia scrutiny but to truly become an absolute measure of representing my readiness for consideration in potential employment opportunities.

[Software Design & Engineering](https://github.com/spollard386/Spollard.github.io/tree/main/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering)

This is Texturing a Pyramid module it was created for class CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. the premise of this project was to create a 3D pyramid with added Texture. My enhancement changed the tradional texture and also added a rotating light source circles the 3D pyramid showing the light hitting 3 faces of the pyramid with an amber lighting.

[Algorithm and Data Structure](https://github.com/spollard386/Spollard.github.io/tree/main/Algorithm%20and%20Data%20Structure)

C++ Program developed and written in Visual Studio
Where a 1D object was enhanced create a 3D Cube 
including adding a rotational aspect  to the cube as well as full
mouse control so that the view is able to pull the cube closer
and futher should the user choose to. I also added a personal touch just to remind myself why I create this.

### Databases

[Databases](https://github.com/spollard386/Spollard.github.io/tree/main/Database)

Created using Visual Studio and enhanced with Pycharm 
and SQlite3. a databese was created with specific tables 
and imported information though sqlite3. this project was to show the creation
of a Student Registration database in SQL while learning PyCharm and well as SQlite3 both whom I've never worked with before, and it turned out better than I had imagined
